Welcome to Fidelity, A Westworld Host Creator

With this app you may log in as a user then create, edit, and delete your own robotic 'Hosts'.

Any user can view and search for hosts. Signed in users can add hosts (and edit them) as well as view usersâ€™ hosts. However, users may not edit or delete hosts created by another user.
